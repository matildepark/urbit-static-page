## Overview

As of Urbit v0.8.0, the eyre vane (HTTP server) of Arvo no longer automatically mounts everything in the `/web` folder. It now works through the declaration of endpoints. 

This is a boilerplate for that, using a static Gall agent, current as of v.0.10.0+.

This boilerplate will mount everything in /app/staticsite to "/~staticsite" on your ship's HTTP server. If your ship is `~sampel-palnet` and you have enabled [DNS proxying](https://urbit.org/using/operations/using-your-ship/#planets-and-stars), your site will be available on `http://sampel-palnet.arvo.network/~staticsite`. 

You can also set any domain name to your ship's IP address, if you prefer.

### Usage

1. Clone this repo.
2. If you want to rename the app or the endpoint, you can do either respectively by renaming `staticsite.hoon` and the `staticsite` folder, for the app; and all mentions of `~staticsite` in the former `staticsite.hoon` for the endpoint. Feel free to add your HTML, CSS, and JS files to the folder when ready.
3. Copy everything in `urbit/app` to your Urbit ship's pier, within its respective /app folder.
4. `|commit %home` and `|start %your-app-name`.
5. e m b r a c e g e o c i t i e s
